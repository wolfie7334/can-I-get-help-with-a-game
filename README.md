# can-I-get-help-with-a-game
im making a game and I am looking for some help, any is appreciated! the game is meant to be a 2D platformer adventure game with several bosses for players to beat and unlock more areas to explore, my ultimate goal with this project is to create a new world for players to explore, and keep them coming back too, any help I can get with coding is very much appreciated, as I am VERY new to coding, thank you for your consideration and taking your time to read this idea I have.
